Say you have a work and a personal GitHub account. You’re working on one machine and have several projects, some of which you want to push to your personal account or vice versa. This is where you can use SSH keys so that you don’t have to keep re-entering your username and password to identify yourself. What you do is you generate a SSH key. When you do this you get a pair, one being public and the other private. The public one is what you provide to GitHub and the private one stays on your computer. The changes you push will only be allowed when they keys match.
